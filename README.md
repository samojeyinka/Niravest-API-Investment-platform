## Niravest
Niravest is a Ruby on Rails API for an investment platform, designed for speed and clarity. It features user authentication with Devise and password security with JWT. The API allows users to sign up, log in, and access both admin and ordinary user functionalities. Admins can create investment packages with details such as name, price, daily profits, and monthly profits, which users can activate by paying for them. Users can also add packages to their watchlist and later activate them. The API provides high-level authentication and security, issuing tokens for secure interactions. Work is ongoing, with new features continuously being added. API documentation will be available soon.
